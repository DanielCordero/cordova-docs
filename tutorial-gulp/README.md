#Using Gulp with Your Cordova Projects

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is an increasingly popular JavaScript based task runner with a large number of [useful plugins](http://gulpjs.com/plugins/) designed to automate common “tasks” for everything from compilation, to packaging, deployment, or simply copying files around. Both Gulp and the Apache Cordova™ Command Line interface (CLI) are node.js based which makes the two highly complementary technologies. In this tutorial we will cover a few ways Gulp can be used with Cordova:

1.  [Invoking Gulp Tasks in a Cordova Build](#invoke)
2.  [Using Gulp to Build Cordova in a Team / CI Environment](#ci)
3.  [Compiling TypeScript](#ts)
