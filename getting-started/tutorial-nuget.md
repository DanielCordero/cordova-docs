# Using NuGet in Cordova projects

[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) is the package manager for the Microsoft development platform. It has client tools to produce and consume packages and a gallery where all the packages are hosted. In addition to popular .NET packages, it also hosts many popular Javascript frameworks that are typically used in an ASP.NET application.
