#Add Azure App Service Mobile App

##Overview

Azure App Service is a cloud app service that integrates everything you need to quickly and easily build 
[web](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/) and [mobile](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/mobile/) 
apps for any platform or device. 

With the [Mobile Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/learning-paths/appservice-mobileapps/) feature of Azure App Service, 
itâ€™s easy to rapidly build engaging Cordova apps. Azure mobile apps helps you to easily authenticate users, access the cloud data and send 
push notifications. You can create a no code backend in minutes and extend it to add custom logic C# or Node.js as you would like.
