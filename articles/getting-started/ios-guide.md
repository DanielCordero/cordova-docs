# Setup guide: Target iOS mobile devices in a Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova project

If you want to build an iOS version of your app, you'll need a Mac to do it. Currently, there is no way to build an iOS app without one. You can use a physical Mac or a cloud-hosted one. Just make sure that it's running Mac OS X Mavericks or later.

In this guide, we'll help you get everything setup right so that you can build, run, and debug your app. We'll stop a few times to check and see if everything is working as expected. If something isn't behaving, we'll propose a few ideas that have worked for others.

Let's help you set things up.

## Install a few things onto your Mac

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

2. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/).

3. In the **Launchpad**, open **Xcode**.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/xcode-icon.png)

4. Accept the license agreement and then close Xcode.

    This seems like a strange step, but our tools depend on Xcode and it won't run until you this license.

4. Open a Terminal app, and type this command.

    ```
     xcode-select -â€“install
    ```
    This installs the Xcode command-line tools.

4. In the Terminal app, type this command.

    ```
     sudo npm install -g remotebuild
    ```

   This installs the *remote agent*. It's a secure build server that you run on your mac. You'll connect to it from your Windows computer so that you can build, run, and debug iOS apps in Visual Studio.

## <a id="remoteAgent"></a>Start the remote agent on your Mac

You can start the remote agent in secure mode or without secure mode.

### Option 1: Start the remote agent (secure mode)

This is the safest mode. Visual Studio uses SSL certificates to securely transfer build payloads to the remote agent.

This mode protects your intellectual property from being intercepted because your build payload is encrypted. It also reduces the likelihood that outsiders will use the open port of your remote agent to run malicious code. When you start the agent in secure mode, you'll get a PIN. The only way to establish a connection with the remote host is by using that PIN.  

To start the remote agent in secure mode, type this command.

```
 remotebuild
```

The agent installs [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), and then starts. The host name, port number, and security pin appear in the Terminal app.  

![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/IC816236.png)

You'll use those pieces of information in the next section. In fact, you'll want to do that part fairly soon because the security pin is active for only 10 minutes.

### Option 2: Start the remote agent (without secure mode)

This is the easiest yet riskiest way to start the remote agent. Visual Studio uses simple HTTP connections to transfer build payloads.

Often times when folks have trouble connecting Visual Studio to their remote agent, they'll start their remote agent without secure mode and the connection issue disappears.

Start the remote agent without secure mode only if you are comfortable with the trade-offs between risk and convenience.

For example, if your Mac is publically accessible over the internet and has access to sensitive materials, you'll probably want to run your remote agent in secure mode. If your mac is accessible only to you, it's easier and less error prone to run your remote agent without secure mode.  

To start the remote agent **without** secure mode, type this command

```
 remotebuild --secure false
```

The agent installs [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), and then starts. The host name, and port number appear in the Terminal app.  

You'll use those pieces of information in the next section.

## <a id="getInfo"></a>Connect Visual Studio to the remote agent

1. On your Windows computer, open Visual Studio.

2. On the Visual Studio menu bar, choose **Tools**->**Options**.

4. In the **Options** dialog box, open **Tools for Apache Cordova**, and then choose **Remote Agent Configuration**.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/options-dialog.png)

5. Add the host name and port number to the appropriate fields in this dialog box.

6. If your using secure mode, set the **Secure mode** field to **True**, and then add the security pin.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/secure-mode.png)

    If your not using secure mode, set the **Secure mode** filed to **False**, and then leave the **Security PIN** field blank.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/non-secure-mode.png)

5. Choose the **OK** button to close this dialog box.

    Visual Studio connects to the remote agent. If you don't receive any errors, you've successfully connected.

### Troubleshooting: Let's fix it

[Did you receive an error that relates to your certificate?](#certificates)

[Is the host name of your Mac not resolving?](#hostname)

[Have you been told that your security PIN invalid or has expired?](#securitypin)

[Are you experiencing a symptom that does not appear in this list?](#stack)

## Run your app in an iOS simulator

1. On the Standard toolbar, choose the **iOS** platform.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/ios-platform.png)

2. Choose **iPhone 5** simulator.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/ios-simulator.png)

3. Press the F5 key to start the app.

    As your app builds, you'll see messages appear in the Terminal app on your mac. This means that Visual Studio has successfully connected to the remote agent and is using that agent to build and deploy your app to the mac.

    When the build is complete, your app will appear in the iPhone 5 simulator on your Mac.

## Create a provisioning profile

You'll need a *provisioning profile* to run your app on a device. Create one by using an Apple Developer account. You can also create one with your free Apple ID but there are limitations. See [Supported Capabilities](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/SupportedCapabilities/SupportedCapabilities.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH38-SW1).

### Create a provisioning profile by using an Apple Developer account

First, enroll in the Apple Developer Program. Then, create an App ID, request a certificate, and register your device.

You'll use that information to create a provisioning profile. Let's go through each step in this process.

**Enroll in the Apple Developer program**

See [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/).

**Request a certificate**

1. Connect your device to your Mac. Make sure that  your device is turned on.

2. Start Xcode.

3. In Xcode, add your Apple ID (if you haven't done so already).

    See [Adding an Apple ID to Your Accounts](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-accounts_preferences/articles/add_appleid.html).

4. In the menu bar, choose **Xcode**->**Preferences**.

5. In the **Accounts** page, choose the **View Details** button.

5. In the account details page, choose the **Create** button next to the **iOS Development** signing identity.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/create-cert.png)

6. Choose the **Done** button to close the account details page.

**Create an App ID**

You don't have to create an explicit App ID to build and test your app. We'll create a wildcard App ID.

1. On your Mac, open Safari, and log into the Apple Developer [Member Center](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action).

2. On the [Member Center](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action) page, choose the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifiers/bundle/bundleList.action) link.

    Take a look at the list of App ID's. If a ```*``` appears in the ID field of any of them, then you already have a wildcard App ID. Sometimes Xcode generates this for you. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

3. If you don't have a wildcard App ID, choose the Add button to create one.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/add-wildcard.png)

    The [Registering an App ID](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifiers/bundle/bundleCreate.action) page appears.

4. Choose the **Wildcard App ID** option and place a ```*``` in  the **Bundle ID** field.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/wildcard-asterix.png)

5. Add any other required information to the page, and then choose the **Continue** button.

6. In the **Confirm your App ID** page, choose the **Submit** button.

    The **Registration complete** page appears.

**Register your device**

1. In the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** page, choose the **All** link that is located under the **Devices** heading.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/devices.png)

2. Choose the Add button.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/add-device.png)

3. In the [Registering a New Device or Multiple Devices](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/device/deviceCreate.action) page, provide the name and *UDID* of the device, and then choose teh **Continue** button.

    *UDID* stands for Unique Device Identifier. It's a 40-character string uniquely identifies your device. You can find it by using ITunes. See [How to obtain the identifier Number (UDID) for an iPhone, iPod, or iPad](http://www.wikihow.com/Obtain-the-Identifier-Number-(UDID)-for-an-iPhone,-iPod-or-iPad).

4. In the **Review and register** page, choose the **Register** button.

**Create a provisioning profile**


1. On the [Member Center](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action) page, choose the [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/overview.action) link.

2. In the [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/overview.action) page, choose the [Provisioning Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/profileLanding.action) link.

3. In the [Provisioning Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/profileLanding.action) page, choose the Add button.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/new-profile.png)

4. In the [What type of provisioning profile do you need?](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/profileCreate.action)A page, choose the **iOS App Development** option, and then choose the **Continue** button.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/add-developer-profile.png)

5. In the **Select App ID** page, choose the wildcard App ID that you just created, and then choose the **Continue** button.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/choose-app-id.png)

6. In the **Select certificates** page, select the checkbox next to the certificate that you created earlier, and then choose the **Continue** button.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/choose-cert.png)

7. In the **Select devices** page, select the checkbox next to the device that you registered earlier, and then choose the **Continue** button.

8. In the **Name this profile and generate** page, name your profile, and then choose the **Generate** button.

9. In the **Your provisioning profile is ready** page, choose the **Download** button.

10. Open Xcode.

11. In Xcode, add your Apple ID (if you haven't done so already).

    See [Adding an Apple ID to Your Accounts](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-accounts_preferences/articles/add_appleid.html).

12. In the menu bar, choose **Xcode**->**Preferences**.

13. In the **Accounts** page, choose the **View Details** button.

     ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/download-profile.png)

15. Choose the **Done** button to close the account details page.

### Create a provisioning profile by using your free Apple ID

First, take some time to [review the limitations](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/SupportedCapabilities/SupportedCapabilities.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH38-SW1) of this type of provisioning profile. If you're comfortable with those limitations, let's get started!

1. Start Xcode 7.

2. In Xcode 7, add your Apple ID.

    See [Adding an Apple ID to Your Accounts](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-accounts_preferences/articles/add_appleid.html).

3. In Xcode 7, choose **File**->**New**->**Project**.

4. In the **Choose a template for your new project** dialog box, choose the iOS Application category of templates, choose any template, and then choose the **Next** button.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/new-project.png)

5. Name your product, organization, and identifier anything you want, and then choose the **Next** button.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/project-settings.png)

6. Choose a location to save your project, and then choose the **Create** button.

    The **General** page of the project properties appears.

7. In the **Team** pop-up menu, choose your Apple ID.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/project-properties.png)

8. Connect your device to your Mac. Make sure that  your device is turned on.

9. In the **Scheme** pop-up menu, choose your device.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/device-choose.png)

    If the device has the message **version lower than deployment target**, you can either update the operating system of your device or choose a version of iOS from the **Deployment Target** pop-up menu that matches the operating system version of your device.

10. If a **Fix Issue** button appears below the **Team** pop-up menu, choose that button.

    Xcode creates a provisioning profile and the **Fix Issue** button disappears.

11. Choose the **Run** button to run your project.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/run-button.png)

    Running your project, ensures that your provisioning profile works. Xcode installs your blank app to the device and then starts it.

## Run your app on a device

### Connect the device to a Mac


#### On your Mac

1. Connect a device (if you haven't done so already).

2. Make sure that your device is turned on.

3. Make sure that the remote agent is running.

    See [Start the remote agent on your mac](#remoteAgent).


#### On your Windows computer

1. In Visual Studio, open the project for your app.

2. On the Standard toolbar, choose the **iOS** platform.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/ios-platform.png)

3. Choose **Remote Device**.

    ![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/remote-device.png)

4. Press the F5 key to start your app.

    Visual Studio builds your app by connecting to the remote agent on your mac. When the build is complete, your app appears on the device that is connected to your mac.

### Connect the device to a Windows computer

Put Leo's cool stuff in here.

If you plan to build, run, and debug your iOS app on a device that you connect to a Windows computer, you'll have to create a provisioning profile by using an Apple Developer account.

* [Apple iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/).

You'll also need these things.

### Troubleshooting: Let's fix it

- Check to see that you have XCode installed. If you accepted the blah prompt, you'll install the command-line tools but not XCode. Go to blah and install it. Then, open XCode to accept the license agreement and restart remoteBuild.

- If you install XCode from this prompt. exit remoteBuild, open XCode and accept the license agreement. Then restart remotebuild.

- Your computer went to sleep and the network that your PC has connected to is different than your corporate network. Change the preferred networks

- Still not working? Let us know? add a DISCUSS comment below.

- Ensure that you are targetting a version of Cordova that is supported by remoteBuild. The earliest version you can use is 4.3. Open your Config.xml and make sure that your CLI version is higher. Link folks to the CLI upgrade topic that I plan to write so that they can evaluate the risks. Link to stack question where I learned about this - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33844896/vs-2015-tools-for-apache-cordova-ios-remote-build-not-using-buildserver

If build hangs or does not execute - make sure that your node.js version and Cordova version are compatable. Here is link to the known issues article - http://taco.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/known-issues-general/#strongbuild-hangs-or-does-not-execute-when-building-for-ios-with-cordova-lt-533-and-nodejs-400strong and a link to the stack article - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33791687/ios-remote-build-fails-in-visual-studio-taco

## Stop the remote agent on your Mac

In the Terminal app on your Mac, press Ctrl+C.

## Troubleshooting: Let's fix it

### <a id="certificate">Did you receive an error that relates to your certificate?

This can happen when Visual Studio has trouble finding your Mac on the network.

On your Windows computer, open a **Command Prompt**, and *ping* the IP address of your Mac. For example, if the IP address of your mac is 10.83.51.174, you'd type ```ping 10.83.51.174```.

If you don't receive any return messages in the **Command Prompt** window, your Mac and your Windows computer might be connected to different networks.

This can happen sometimes when your company has more than one Wi-Fi network.  When a Mac wakes from a sleep, it connects to the first available Wi-Fi network. That might not be the network of your Windows computer.

This image shows a preferred order of Wi-Fi networks.

![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/preferred-network.png)

The **MSFTCORP** Wi-Fi network appears first. When this Mac wakes from a sleep, it will to it.

The network that is used by your Windows Computer should appear first in this list. Otherwise, you'll experience these issues intermittently.

### <a id="hostname">Is the host name of your Mac not resolving?

First, make sure that the **Host** name in Visual Studio matches computer name in the in the **Sharing** settings of your Mac.

![Cordova_iOS_Install_Agent](media/ios-guide/host-name.png)

Alternatively, you can set the **Host** name in Visual Studio to the IP address that appears in the **Network** settings of your Mac.

-- show image here - need to get that from work.

### <a id="securitypin">Have you been told that your security PIN is invalid or has expired?

This can happen the first time you set things up. When you first start the remote agent, your security PIN is good for only 10 minutes. then it expires. Just generate a new one.

1. First, stop the remote agent. On your Mac, open a Terminal app, and type CTRL+C to stop it.

2. In the Terminal app, type ```remotebuild certificates generate```.

    Your new security PIN appears in the Terminal app window. Add that PIN to the **Security PIN** field in Visual Studio.

    If this doesn't work, return to your Mac and in the Terminal app, type ```remotebuild certificates reset``` and then type ```remotebuild certificates generate``` to get another PIN number.

Still not working? Reach out to us [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/visual-studio-cordova).

### <a id="safari"> You've been told that we were unable to find the app you're trying to debug

On your device, open the Safari settings and enable the **Web Inspector** setting.

See [Safari iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007874-CH2-SW8).

##### Not sure I need bucket

##### Install these things on your Mac



##### Configure npm package cache permissions

If you have an older version of Node.js and npm, type this command:

```
sudo chown -R `whoami` ~/.npm
```

Newer versions of Node.js and npm will automatically configure the permissions of the npm package cache in your home directory.

If you pass this don't worry, you can reinstall the command-line tools by doing this:

To install these, open a Terminal app on your Mac, and type this command: ```xcode-select -â€“install```.

#### An error occurs when you attempt to use local or remote device build

Make sure you have XCode 7 installed. This prevents you from having to use a provisioning profile and apple developer account to build and debug your apps.

#### Explore configuration files - show how to save the settings, about the default settings, and some of the other commands that you can use
