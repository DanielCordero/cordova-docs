## Writing Best Practices

### Before writing anything, ask 'why?'

Not every issue needs an article. Tools for Apache Cordova is as multi-featured as it is awesome. If we wrote an article for each thing you can do while building your app on Visual Studio, we'd have no time to develop cool products! Adding a new article may actually decrease the visibility of your topic, because its just another page people have to sift through and find. 

More often than not, there's already an article on the same general topic you're writing about. Don't worry about no one finding it! Because of page navigation within each article, it's easy for readers to find the right content on each page. 

### Execution-oriented organization

Good documentation is like a well-built staircase. You ascend it, step by step, to get from one place to another. No one would use a staircase where the step heights were out of order. Likewise, you especially wouldn't take that staircase if it were leading you nowhere.

Let docs be a guide to take your audience from one level of understanding to another. They should help a user achieve a certain goal, or become able to performa specific task. 

Trace the path of the user, step by step, through your article, and try not to include too many diversions from the main task at hand. Sure, there are many edge cases in the implementation of any feature, but try to strike the right balance between direction and information. Your reader will appreciate it. 

### A picture is worth...at least three paragraphs of button description. 

We love the screenshots! Bolster the various steps or parts of your article with pictures and other multimedia. Our repo follows a specfic file system. Each article has a 'media/[article title]' folder at the same level of the article. It houses all images for that article. 

For example, the ["Debug Your App in Visual Studio"](http://taco.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/debug-using-visual-studio/) article, which is stored as [a markdown file in the cordova-docs repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-docs/tree/master/articles/debug-and-test), has a media folder that contains all the images of that article. Every article has a similar file system.
